**Research:**  I am committed to advancing fundamental AI algorithms for medical imaging.

**Previously:** I reveived my Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Xi&#39;an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Zongben Xu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zbxu) and co-advised by [Prof. Jian Sun](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/jiansun/publications). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Ocean University of China](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/).During my doctoral studies, I concentrated on the development of fundamental algorithms in artificial intelligence, including meta-learning and continual learning.
