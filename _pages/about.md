### Research:

My research aims to develop advanced medical image reconstruction techniques by leveraging large language models, large vision models, and multimodal foundation models. The goal is to achieve more accurate and clinically relevant medical image reconstruction.

### About Me: 

I am an Assistant Professor at Xi’an Jiaotong University. My graduate advisor was Academician [Prof. Zongben Xu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zbxu), with joint guidance from Professor [Prof. Jian Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SSgNWOMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and My postdoctoral advisor was Professor [Jianhua Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dG5Ix6EAAAAJ&hl=en).

During doctoral studies, my research focused on deep learning paradigms in open-world scenarios, with notable achievements in continual learning and automated machine learning. In recent years, I have led a sub-project of the National Key R&D Program and a General Postdoctoral Project. I have published seven papers in top-tier international journals and conferences in artificial intelligence and computer vision, including IEEE TPAMI, CVPR, and AAAI. I also had the honor of delivering an oral presentation at CVPR, one of the leading conferences in computer vision.My work has been recognized as the Outstanding Paper at the 19th Young Scientists Conference of the China Society of Image and Graphics, and I received second place in the “Continual Learning for Sequential Tasks” track at the 2nd Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (Huangpu) International Algorithm Case Competition.

I also serve as a reviewer for leading journals and conferences, including Nature Communications, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TIP, IEEE TMI, CVPR, ICCV, and others.

### Open Positions:

The research group is well-funded. Prospective students interested in pursuing a Master's, Ph.D., or Postdoctoral position are welcome to contact me by email with their CV (wangshipeng@xjtu.edu.cn).
