I will be joining the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE) and Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at California Institute of Technology as an Assistant Professor starting from January 2024. I am currently seeking self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows to join my research group in Fall 2023. Candidates with backgrounds in CS, EE, mathematics, physics, or statistics are especially encouraged to apply. If you are interested in working with me as a Ph.D. student, please apply to Caltech CMS/EE and mention my name in your applications. If you are interested in a postdoc position, please contact me directly.
